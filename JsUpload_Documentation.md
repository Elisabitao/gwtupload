_JSUpload is the exported version of the GWTUpload library._

_The library has been developed using java and exported to javascript using gwt-compiler and [gwt-exporter](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-exporter/) library._



# Goals #

  * The library can be used directly, without the need of knowing anything about gwt and java.
  * The generated javascript code is minimized, optimized, obfuscated, and doesn't depend on any other library.
  * The library works fine in all browsers supported by gwt.
  * The library provides a simple cgi-bin written in perl that can be used in most web servers.

# Setup instructions #

  1. Download last version of the library: jsupload-x.x.x.zip and uncompress it in a folder.
  1. In the server side you have to install one of the provided server programs to receive the files:
    * CGI: put the jsupload.cgi.pl (included in jsupload-x.x.x.zip) into the cgi-bin folder of your web server, and set the action parameter in your javascript code pointing to it.
```
   uploader = new jsu.Upload({
      action: "/cgi-bin/jsupload.cgi.pl" 
      [...]
   });
```
    * PHP: Install PHP-APC and put the lines below in your php.ini file. Then install the provided script in any php folder enable in your web server. You have to add
```
    [APC]
    apc.enabled=1
    apc.shm_segments=1
    apc.shm_size=64
    apc.max_file_size=10M
    apc.stat=1
    apc.rfc1867="1"
    apc.rfc1867_freq="0"
```
```
   uploader = new jsu.Upload({
      action: "[...]/jsupload.php" 
      [...]
   });
   var e = document.createElement("INPUT")
   e.type = "hidden";
   e.name = "APC_UPLOAD_PROGRESS";
   e.value = u.data().name;
   uploader.addElement(e, 0);
```
    * Java: You can use the servlet provided with gwtupload.jar and setup it in WEB-INF/web.xml file.
    * Rails: You can use the cgi script provided. If you wanted to collaborate in a port for rails, please let me know.
    * Others: Install the provided cgi script which leaves the files and information in a temporary folder. Them, use an ajax request to inform your application that the upload process has finished.
```
   uploader = new jsu.Upload({
      onFinish: function(data) {
        [call to your application, read the cookie set by the cgi uploader to know where are the uploaded files]
      } 
   });
```
  1. Include javascript library in your html file.  You can use relative paths or full qualified ones because the library has been compiled using cross-site linker. The library takes care loading dynamically the needed images and css.
```
     <script language="javascript" src="[...]/jsupload.JsUpload.nocache.js"></script>
```
  1. In your html code, define the jsuOnLoad() function wich will be called once the library is loaded.
```
     <script language='javascript'>
      function jsuOnLoad() {
        [...]
      }
     </script>
```


# Library API #

## Upload ##
_Exportable version of gwt Uploader.
>_<h3>Features</h3>
> <ul>
<blockquote><li>Three kind of progress bar, the most advanced one shows upload speed, time remaining, sizes, progress</li>
<li>Single upload form: while the file is being sent the modal dialog avoid the user to interact with the application,<br>
Then the form can be used again for uploading more files.</li>
<li>Multiple upload form: Each time the user selects a file it goes to the queue and the user can select more files.</li>
<li>It can call configurable functions on the events of on Change, on Start and on Finish</li>
<li>The user can cancel the current upload, can delete files in the queue or remove uploaded files</li>
</ul>

# Server script (jsupload.cgi.pl) #
  * The provided server script has been written in perl for the GWTUpload/JSUpload library.
  * This script requires perl, CGI and Digest::MD5, which are installed by default in most linux/unix distributions.
  * You have to put this file in a script/cgi-bin enabled folder of your web server, and you have to set the rigth execution permissions.
  1. **Operation**:
    * When it receives a POST request, it updates periodically a status file with the progress,       and stores all received form elements in a temporary folder for the user session.
    * When it receives GET requests, returns a xml response with the progess information.
    * When the GET request, has the parameter show=xxxx, it returns the content of the form      element whose name is xxxx. If the element is a file it sends a response with the adequate      content-type, otherwise it returns a xml response with the element's value.
  1. **Configuration**: At the top of the script you have some customizable variables.
    * $idname: is the name for the sessionid cookie name, you could redefine it to match              the name of the cookie set by your application. By default the name is CGISESSID.
    * $tmp\_dir: is the prefix used in the path location to store the data received. By default              it is set to "/tmp/uploader", normally you have to change it to match the path              configured in your application. It is strongly recommended that this directory               should be created apart from "/tmp", in a non-httpd accessible path.
    * $max\_size: is the maximum size in bytes allowed for the entire request size, note that it is not              the real file size because the request includes the headers and could have more              files or parameters. Normally only one file is transfered, and the request size              is very closed to the file size.
    * $mkpath: if true jsupload will create the folder to store the received data, otherwise              it is the application the responsible of creating it. Note that setting it to false               your system is protected to be used as a surreptitious storage area. The files               in this folder will be created with the default perl permissions (0666 or the user umask),               so in the case you leave the application to create the folder be aware to set the              appropriate permissions.
    * $slow:   if it has a value greater than zero, after each chunk received, jsupload will sleep              for this value in seconds (it may be fractional). It is used to see the progress bar               in fast networks when you are testing or developing your app.
  1. **Integration**:
    * The files are stored in the folder $tmp\_dir/xxxx where xxxx is the session id (cookie CGISESSID).
    * For each form element received, it stores a file /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.info      where yyyy is the name of the element.
    * In the case of file elements, it puts the content of the file in the file     /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.bin.
    * The application must create, handle, and clean $tmp\_dir files.
# Server script (jsupload.php) #
  * Server script written in php for the GWTUpload/JSUpload library.
  * This script requires PHP with PHP-APC.
  * You have to put this file in a php enabled folder of your web server.
  1. **Server Configuration**:
> > In order to enable the PHP APC extension to support file upload progress indication   you have to add the following section into php.ini:
```
    [APC]
    ....
    extension=apc.so
    [APC]
    apc.enabled=1
    apc.shm_segments=1
    apc.shm_size=64
    apc.max_file_size=10M
    apc.stat=1
    apc.rfc1867="1"
    apc.rfc1867_freq="0"
```
> > Previously you must install apc extension in your system, normally installing    php-devel php-pear pcre-devel   And running    pecl install apc   But you might read the apc documentation.
  1. **Client side**:
> > In the client you have to add a hidden widget to the uploader in the first position.
    * Gwt-upload
```
       uploader.add(new Hidden("APC_UPLOAD_PROGRESS", uploader.getInputName()), 0);
```
    * Js-upload
```
       var e = document.createElement("INPUT")
       e.type = "hidden";
       e.name = "APC_UPLOAD_PROGRESS";
       e.value = u.data().name;
       u.addElement(e, 0);
```
  1. **Configuration**: At the top of the script there is a customizable variable.
    * $uploaddir: is the prefix used in the path location to store the data received. By default                 it is set to "/tmp/php\_upload/", normally you have to change it to match the path                 configured in your application. It is strongly recommended that this directory                 should be created apart from "/tmp", in a non-httpd accessible path.
  1. **Integration**:
    * The files are stored in the folder $tmp\_dir/xxxx where xxxx is the session id (cookie PHPSESSID).
    * For each file received, it stores a file /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.info,     where yyyy is the name of the element, with the original filename and its content-type.
    * The content of the file in the file will be in the /tmp/uploader/xxxx/yyyy.bin file.
    * The application must create, handle, and clean $tmp\_dir files.
    * You should check that the user session is valid in order to avoid that your server could     be used as a used as a surreptitious storage area.
